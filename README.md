# Scripts for Collected Notes

This repository contains a collection of scripts for [Collected Notes](http://collectednotes.com/).

The scripts pull data from different data sources, and render markdown files. These files are then posted to Collected Notes. The repository currently integrates with:

* [Strong](https://www.strong.app/) CSV files

## Setup

The scripts require a couple of variables to run. Set your Collected Notes email address and API token as environment variables:

```
export COLLECTED_NOTES_API_TOKEN=...
export COLLECTED_NOTES_API_EMAIL=...
export COLLECTED_NOTES_SITE_ID=...
```

You can find your email and API token [here](https://collectednotes.com/accounts/me/token).

You can find your site ID by editing any post:

```
https://collectednotes.com/sites/<site ID>/notes/<post ID>/edit
```

## Templates

The `templates` directory has markdown templates. The templates use Python's built-in [Template](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#template-strings) class. It's simple, but it works. Variables are defined using [PEP 292](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0292) formatting.

Templates are rendered using the `render_posts.sh` script. This script is specific to my templates and use cases. You should customize it based on your needs.

NOTE: The template filenames must be of the format:

```
template_name.post_id.md
```

See the `templates` directory for examples. The post ID is how the `upload_posts.py` script determines which post to update. You must create the notes manually using the Collected Notes UI. Edit the post to see the post ID in the URL.

## Posting

You can upload your rendered templates using the `upload_posts.py` script. This script uses the environment variables from the setup section to upload your posts to Collected Notes.

## About

You might notice some strange design decisions with these scripts. I have gone out of my way not to depend on anything outside packages. No virtual environment is required. No pip installs. Just simply Python and Bash scripts.
