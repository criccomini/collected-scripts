# Scripts for Collected Notes

This repository contains a collection of scripts for [Collected Notes](http://collectednotes.com/).

The scripts pull data from different data sources, and render markdown files. These files are then posted to Collected Notes. The repository currently integrates with:

* [Strong](https://www.strong.app/) CSV files

## Setup

The scripts require a couple of variables to run. Set your Collected Notes email address and API token as environment variables:

```
export COLLECTED_NOTES_API_TOKEN=...
export COLLECTED_NOTES_API_EMAIL=...
```

You can find your email and API token [here](https://collectednotes.com/accounts/me/token).
